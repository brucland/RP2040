# RP2040
Building an understanding of the Pi RP2040 by iterative programming and head-scratching.

I am a retired lecturer from Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University where I taught hardware design courses
for over 20 years. I have taught using Atmel AVR, Microchip PIC32, and Altera/Intel Cyclone 2, 4 and 5 FPGAs.
The courses are now being taught by Van Hunter Adams. 
Last years web pages are at 
https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/index.html
and

For the last five years I also taught a technical writing course.

Now Hunter and I are looking for the next architecture to use for the microcontroller course.
